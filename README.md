# Tunic Keyboard

This is a small Windows Forms project written in .NET 6 C#. It will allow both the translating of the Tunic runes into phonetic English and creating runes from English phonemes. It will perform proper consonant/vowel ordering and allow inserting spaces into the results.

This project is based on the game Tunic by Andrew Shouldice and the Isometricorp Games Ltd. team, published by Finji, LLC. None of the game assets were used in the making of this project.

This is a work-in-progress, as there are other features to be added. Saving text/runes to files and adding a backspace are being planned now.

The project can be compiled using any version of Visual Studio 2022 or higher.

This source code is unlicenced and in the public domain. It may be freely downloaded, modified, and redistributed in any form without restrictions. It comes with no warranty of any kind, including the ability to download, compile, and/or run this project successfully, and no warranty as to the accuracy of the algorithms.
